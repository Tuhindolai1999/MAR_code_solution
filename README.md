1. Infix to postfix convertion

Q. what is infix expression & postfix expresion?

ans : infix - operand1 (operator) operand2

example : a + b ; where a = operand1, b=operand2, '+'=operator

postfix - (operand1)(operand2)operator

example : ab+ ; where a=operand1,b=operand2,'+'=operator

Q: why do we need to convert infix expression to postfix expression?

ans : Infix expressions are readable and solvable by humans. We can easily distinguish the order of operators, and also can use the parenthesis to solve that part first during solving mathematical expressions. The computer cannot differentiate the operators and parenthesis easily, thatâ€™s why postfix conversion is needed.
