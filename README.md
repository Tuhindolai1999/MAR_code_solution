1. Infix to postfix convertion

Q. what is infix expression & postfix expresion?

ans : infix - operand1 (operator) operand2

example : a + b ; where a = operand1, b=operand2, '+'=operator

postfix - (operand1)(operand2)operator

example : ab+ ; where a=operand1,b=operand2,'+'=operator

Q: why do we need to convert infix expression to postfix expression?

ans : Infix expressions are readable and solvable by humans. We can easily distinguish the order of operators, and also can use the parenthesis to solve that part first during solving mathematical expressions. The computer cannot differentiate the operators and parenthesis easily, thatâ€™s why postfix conversion is needed.


2. Towe of hanoy problem : 
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 

-> Only one disk can be moved at a time.

-> Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.

-> No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
